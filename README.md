# SEO Playground — Local SEO Dashboard

> **Work in progress** — new DataForSEO endpoints are being added progressively.

SEO Playground is a self-hosted dashboard that lets you run SEO and local SEO queries directly against the [DataForSEO API](https://dataforseo.com/). Every search is saved locally in a SQLite database, so you can browse your history and revisit results without making additional API calls. There is no cloud infrastructure involved — everything runs on your machine.

If you find this useful, consider supporting the project:
